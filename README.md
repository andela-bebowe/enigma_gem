# EnigmaEncrypto

This is my first checkpoint project done under the Andela Institute curriculum titled ENIGMA.

ENIGMA entails creation of an Ecryptor gem like the Ceasar cipher.
Contains encrypt ruby file that when called with two file names as command line arguments, it encrypts the first file and saves in the other.
Also contains decrypt ruby file that when called with two file names, date of creation and a key as command line arguments, it encrypts the first file and saves in the other.
Also includes a little twist where you can actually crack an encrypted file without a key.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'enigma_encrypto'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
